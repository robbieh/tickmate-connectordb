Upload your Tickmate data to ConnectorDB

[Tickmate](https://github.com/lordi/tickmate) is an Android app described as a "one-bit journal".

[ConnectorDB](http://connectordb.io/) is a Quantified Self / IoT server for storing and analyzing event-type data.

This is just a little Python script that takes a Tickmate database backup file and pushes the data into ConnectorDB.

I've been using NextCloud to automatically upload the Tickmate db files, and this now allows me to push those into ConnectorDB automatically.
